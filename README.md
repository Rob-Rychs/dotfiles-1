# .dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, inspired by [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## Get started

Copy the files to your machine and run the bootstrap scripts. The setup will guide you and ask for several things.

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/lgraubner/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

cd ~/.dotfiles

# install dependencies
scripts/install
# bootstrap setup
scripts/bootstrap
```

To update things you can run:

```bash
scripts/update
```
